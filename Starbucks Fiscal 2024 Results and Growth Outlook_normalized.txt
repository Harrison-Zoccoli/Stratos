Starbucks Fiscal 2024 Results and Growth Outlook Financial Results. For fiscal year 2024 (ended Sept 29, 2024), Starbucks reported total net revenues of about $36.2 billion, roughly 1% above the prior year 1 . GAAP net income (net earnings) was $3.76 billion, down about 9% from $4.12 billion in fiscal 2023 2 . (On a diluted per-share basis, GAAP EPS was $3.31, down ~8% from $3.60.) Margins were under pressure: GAAP operating margin fell to ~15.0% (130 basis points lower) as higher labor costs (wages/benefits) and more promotional activity outweighed gains from pricing and supply-chain efficiency 3 . In the fourth quarter, net revenues declined 3% year-over-year to $9.1 billion 4 , with Q 4 EPS of $0.80 (down 25% YOY) as traffic softened. Comparable Store Sales and Regional Results. Global same-store sales fell about 2% for the year. By region, North America comps also dropped ~2% (U. S. down 2%) and International comps fell ~4% (with China down ~8%). Regionally, North America remains by far the largest market: in fiscal 2024 North America contributed roughly $27.01 billion (≈75%) of revenue, versus about $7.34 billion (≈20%) from other international markets 5 . (The remaining ~5% came from the “Channel Development” segment.) Store count continued to grow – over 2,000 net new stores globally in FY 2024 – with ~17,000 in the U. S. and 7,600 in China at year-end. Key Performance Drivers. Management attributed the weaker-than-expected results primarily to soft consumer demand and traffic. Starbucks noted a “pronounced traffic decline” amid a cautious spending environment, despite efforts to boost frequency with promotions and menu innovations 6 7 . U. S. comparable transactions fell, even as average ticket rose. In China, growth was hampered by a slow macroeconomic recovery and intense competition 8 9 . Meanwhile, Starbucks faced cost pressures from rising commodity and labor costs. The Q 4 report highlighted that higher store partner wages and benefits, along with more promotional offers, squeezed operating margins 3 . In Q 4 and Q 1, the company paused planned price hikes even as coffee bean and ingredient costs climbed 10 3 . On the positive side, Starbucks’ digital business and loyalty program remained strong. Active U. S. Rewards membership totaled ~34 million by year-end (up a few percent) 11 12 , and mobile/app ordering accounted for roughly 30–31% of U. S. transactions 13 . (A recent estimate noted Starbucks Rewards members drive ~60% of U. S. company-store sales 14 , and over 22% of global sales come through digital channels 15 .) Strategic Growth Plans. Starbucks continues to pursue long-term expansion and innovation. The company reaffirmed ambitious store targets: for example, an investor presentation aimed at reaching 55,000 stores by 2030 (up from ~40,000 today) 16 . Niccol has also spoken of “eventually doubling” the U. S. store base through format diversification (more drive-thrus, pickup-only stores, etc.) 17 . China remains a key growth market: pre-pandemic plans called for ~9,000 stores in China by 2025 (Starbucks had ~6,800 at end-2022) 18 . International markets are expected to account for roughly one-third of long-term earnings growth 16 . Product innovation is also highlighted – Starbucks is investing in all-day menus and healthier food/snacks to drive visits 19 , while “reinventing” store experiences (e. g. ceramic cups for dine-in, condiment bars, etc.) to strengthen its “third place” appeal 20 7 . The company is also doubling down on digital: it has a goal to double its ~75 million Rewards members in five years and build out AI-driven personalization (with partners like Microsoft and Amazon) 15 .

Management Outlook and Guidance. Given the executive transition and challenging environment, Starbucks did not provide financial guidance for FY 2025. Management stated that full-year 2025 guidance was suspended to allow time to implement a turnaround plan 21 22 . CEO Brian Niccol emphasized the need to “fundamentally change our strategy to win back customers” with his “Back to Starbucks” plan 23 24 . Both Niccol and CFO Rachel Ruggeri have cautioned that the recovery will take time. Ruggeri said, “We are developing a plan to turn around our business, but it will take time” 25 , even as Starbucks modestly raised its quarterly dividend (to $0.61) to signal confidence in long-term growth 25 . Overall, leadership is focused on improving store operations, simplifying the menu/pricing, and re- engaging the brand’s core customer experience. They expect these strategic changes – along with continued investments in digital and international expansion – will restore growth over the medium term, even though near-term comps may remain pressured.
