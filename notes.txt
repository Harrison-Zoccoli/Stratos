***
need to improve chunking for optimization and adj pdf parsing for less structuired pdfs
speed seems good for everything prechunking so far and 0 cost :P

***
chunking adds a lot of bloat seems like 30% increase (est) in tokens due to context based chunking
count consider less context/none or increasing chunk size but may lead to worse results
will revisit after looking at costs and speed
