Starbucks Corporation: Earnings and Growth Analysis by Market (2018–2024) Global Overview (2018–2024) Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) experienced strong overall revenue growth from 2018 through 2023, with consolidated net revenues rising from $24.7 billion in 2018 to about $36.0 billion in fiscal 2023 1 2.Net income (GAAP) was roughly $3.8–4.1 billion by FY 2024.Operating margins fluctuated: for example, GAAP operating margin improved to ~16–18% by FY 2023 but fell below 15% in FY 2024 (to ~14.4%) due to heavy investments in store partner wages and benefits 3.In FY 2022, margin dipped to 14.2% from 18.2% in FY 2021, largely because of wage inflation and training costs 4.From FY 2020 (COVID year) through FY 2022, comparable store sales (global) swung from steep declines (-14% in FY 2020) to strong recoveries (+20% in FY 2021, +8% in FY 2022) as the chain rebounded from pandemic closures 5 6.However, by FY 2024 comparable sales had started to decline again (–2% for full year, –7% in Q 4 FY 2024) 7 3 , signaling consumer demand softening into 2024.Global store count grew steadily, from about 30,000 in 2018 to 40,199 by end-FY 2024 8.Growth has been driven mainly by new store openings in high-potential markets.By late 2024 Starbucks operated roughly 16,941 U.S.stores and 7,596 in China 9.The U.S.and China together account for about 61–62% of the chain’s 40,199 stores 9 10.Other top markets include Japan (~2,000 stores), South Korea (~2,009 stores by 2024) 11 , Canada (~1,500), UK (~1,170), Mexico (~800), Taiwan (~450), the Philippines and Indonesia (several hundred each), among others.Starbucks operates through various structures: in the U.S., China, Canada, and Japan it largely owns and operates stores; in many Asia-Pacific and Latin American countries it uses exclusive license or joint-venture partners.For example, South Korea’s business is a ~67% owned joint venture with Shinsegae (Starbucks Korea), and Starbucks Mexico is fully franchised under Alsea’s operation.Digital initiatives and loyalty have been key global growth drivers.Starbucks Rewards membership in the U.S.grew from about 17.6 million active users (90-day basis) in Q 4 2019 to 33.8 million by Q 4 2024 12 13 , reflecting broad adoption of mobile ordering.By end-2023 over 30% of transactions at U.S.company- operated stores were via the app 14.Globally, Starbucks has set a goal of roughly doubling its ~75 million global Rewards members by 2027 through enhanced digital engagement (mobile order, contactless pay, and personalized marketing).Overall, Starbucks’ global growth was fueled by post-pandemic recovery and premium positioning, but by 2024 it faced pressures from rising labor costs (wage increases for baristas), inflationary input costs, and slowing traffic.Against that backdrop, the company initiated a strategic “Reinvention” focused on in-store efficiency and marketing investments, and in 2024 adopted a new CEO with a “Back to Starbucks” turnaround plan.

S.company- operated stores were via the app 14.Globally, Starbucks has set a goal of roughly doubling its ~75 million global Rewards members by 2027 through enhanced digital engagement (mobile order, contactless pay, and personalized marketing).Overall, Starbucks’ global growth was fueled by post-pandemic recovery and premium positioning, but by 2024 it faced pressures from rising labor costs (wage increases for baristas), inflationary input costs, and slowing traffic.Against that backdrop, the company initiated a strategic “Reinvention” focused on in-store efficiency and marketing investments, and in 2024 adopted a new CEO with a “Back to Starbucks” turnaround plan.Key Global Trends • Labor and Wage Costs: Over 2018–2024 Starbucks progressively raised wages and benefits for its retail partners.In the U.S., starting in 2022 Starbucks committed to $15–17/hour for baristas and higher entry-level wages; similar pressure mounted in other markets.These investments have materially squeezed margins.For instance, Starbucks reported that fiscal 2022 U.S.wages “enhanced store partner wages” and training drove a 400-bp year-over-year decline in Q 4 operating margin 4.In Q 4 FY 2024, continued wage investment was cited as a main driver of a 380-bp drop in GAAP margin 3.Across markets, higher minimum wages (in U.S., UK, Canada, etc.) and labor shortages have made labor costs a principal headwind.• Macroeconomic Headwinds: The post-2021 period saw inflationary pressures on commodities (coffee beans, dairy) and logistics, as well as uneven economic growth.In FY 2023 the UK subsidiary noted that rising dairy and coffee prices and wage inflation required selective price increases to protect margins 15.Globally, Starbucks absorbed some currency translation effects (e.g.Q 4 FY 2022 net revenues included a 3% FX headwind 16 ).By FY 2024, consumer sentiment was challenged by high inflation and interest rates, causing traffic declines (Starbucks U.S.traffic was down ~10% in Q 4 2024 vs.prior year 17 ).• Digital Expansion: Digital channels have become increasingly important.Starbucks has steadily increased the share of mobile/app orders: as of late 2023, over 30% of U.S.in-store transactions were placed via the app 14.Global and local mobile-order-and-pay innovations (e.g.China’s on-demand program, U.S.curbside pickup) have lifted sales and loyalty.Starbucks continues to invest in app features (e.g.customization tools, generative AI enhancements with Microsoft) and store formats catering to mobile orders (pickup-only stores, expanded drive-thrus).• Changing Consumer Behavior: Shifts since COVID include a sustained preference for convenience and value.In developed markets, Starbucks has seen traffic growth lag ticket growth – e.g.in early 2024 U.S.comps reflected higher average checks but fewer transactions 18 19.The company noted that frequency of visits had declined across several customer segments 20.Younger consumers (Gen Z) are reportedly more value- and customization-driven, prompting Starbucks to experiment with tiered pricing, subscription offers, and local menu items to drive trial.• Competition: In all key markets, Starbucks faces intensifying competition.In the U.S., fast-food chains (Mc Donald’s Mc Café, Dunkin’) and premium cafés vie on price and convenience.In China, local rivals like Luckin Coffee and Cotti Coffee have rapidly expanded with lower prices and local flavors; Luckin grew to >22,000 stores by 2024 21.European markets face competition from Costa (now part of Coca-Cola), Nestlé’s Nespresso outlets, and specialty chains.Even in mature Asia markets (Korea, Japan), local chains and tea brands offer alternatives.Starbucks has largely differentiated with brand, digital loyalty and premium store experiences, but competitive pricing and promotional pressure have been noted.United States Historic Performance (2018–2024): The U.S.is Starbucks’ largest market, accounting for about 50–60% of global revenue.From 2018 through 2019, U.S.same-store sales were steady at mid-single-digit growth,.

European markets face competition from Costa (now part of Coca-Cola), Nestlé’s Nespresso outlets, and specialty chains.Even in mature Asia markets (Korea, Japan), local chains and tea brands offer alternatives.Starbucks has largely differentiated with brand, digital loyalty and premium store experiences, but competitive pricing and promotional pressure have been noted.United States Historic Performance (2018–2024): The U.S.is Starbucks’ largest market, accounting for about 50–60% of global revenue.From 2018 through 2019, U.S.same-store sales were steady at mid-single-digit growth,.bolstered by menu price increases and product innovation (e.g.Nitro Cold Brew).The U.S.store count grew modestly, reaching about 15,873 by Nov 2022 22 and 16,941 by end-FY 2024 9.The recovery from COVID was robust: U.S.comps rose about +21% in FY 2021 as lockdowns eased (comparable transactions +8%, ticket +13%) 23.In FY 2022 and FY 2023, U.S.comps continued positive (about +12% for FY 2022 and +8–9% for FY 2023) 24 25.However, by FY 2024 the trend reversed: Q 4 U.S.comps declined ~6% (driven by –10% transactions) 19.Despite softness in frequency, average ticket (through pricing and higher mix) remained higher.U.S.segment net revenues (North America) peaked around $23.4 B in FY 2022 then receded slightly, in line with the –3% comps in FY 2024 26.Operating margins in the U.S.recovered from FY 2020’s pandemic lows but have since narrowed: in Q 4 2024 NA operating margin was ~18.7%, down from 23.2% year-over- year, reflecting deleveraging and wage investments 27.Store Counts and Formats: As of October 2024, roughly 51% of Starbucks’ U.S.locations are company- operated, 49% licensed 9.The U.S.store network includes traditional cafés, a growing number of drive- thru and curbside pickup “convenience-led” formats, and a few Starbucks Reserve Roastery/experience stores.From 2021–2024, Starbucks opened several hundred net new U.S.stores per year; net additions averaged roughly 200–300 annually.The company has also experimented with mini-stores (Starbucks Now) and off-hour grab-and-go outlets in urban areas.Traffic & Transactions: U.S.same-store transactions (traffic) have been pressured recently.Starbucks cited that two factors drove Q 4 FY 2024 – a 10% drop in comparable transactions in North America (vs.+2% prior year) 28.The average ticket per transaction remained positive (+4% in Q 4 FY 2024) due to price and mix.On the positive side, Starbucks’ U.S.loyalty program has thrived: active U.S.Rewards members grew from 24.8 M in late 2021 29 to 33.8 M by Q 4 2024 13.Members now account for a majority of U.S.transactions (approximately 60% as of early 2024 30 ), and digitally-enabled orders (via app or web) exceed 30% of sales 14.Growth Outlook (2025–2027): - Base case: We project modest U.S.revenue growth of ~3–5% annually.This assumes continued menu price increases offsetting some traffic decline, with traffic flattening by 2026.Same-store sales would be roughly flat or slightly negative initially, turning mildly positive (+1–2%) by 2027.Store count may grow ~2–3% per year, adding mainly drive-thru and university/outlet locations.- Upside: If the economy outperforms and Starbucks succeeds in reversing traffic declines (through improved service speed, promotions, or product innovation), comps could recover to mid-single-digit growth.In that scenario, total U.S.revenues could grow 5–7% annually.Higher digital engagement (loyalty expansion, pickup options) could further boost sales.- Downside: A recessionary scenario (e.g.consumer spending cuts, sharp traffic decline) might see comps fall mid-single-digits.Revenue could stagnate or shrink (~–2% per year), especially if Starbucks loses discretionary spend to lower-priced alternatives.Wage inflation and cost pressures could also compress margins further.- Risks: Key risks include a U.

- Upside: If the economy outperforms and Starbucks succeeds in reversing traffic declines (through improved service speed, promotions, or product innovation), comps could recover to mid-single-digit growth. In that scenario, total U. S. revenues could grow 5–7% annually. Higher digital engagement (loyalty expansion, pickup options) could further boost sales. - Downside: A recessionary scenario (e. g. consumer spending cuts, sharp traffic decline) might see comps fall mid-single-digits. Revenue could stagnate or shrink (~–2% per year), especially if Starbucks loses discretionary spend to lower-priced alternatives. Wage inflation and cost pressures could also compress margins further. - Risks: Key risks include a U.S.economic slowdown, intensified competition (e.g.value offerings from competitors), unionization/labor disruptions, and a sustained fall in dine-in visits.Strategic Initiatives: Starbucks is pursuing several initiatives in the U.S.to drive growth.On pricing, it has implemented strategic menu price hikes (with limited promotions) to offset cost inflation, with minimal impact on demand so far.New product innovation (iced/seasonal beverages, health-conscious options) and expansion of food offerings continue to shape demand.Operationally, Starbucks is investing in in-store technology and training to improve speed and service quality (addressing the “Back to Starbucks” plan.

2 billion) 47.However, profitability has compressed; reported operating margin fell from ~10% in 2021 to about 4.8% in 2023 47 , reflecting heavy wage and expansion costs.Stores in South Korea opened at a rapid pace (adding ~116 in 2024 11 ).Seoul alone hosts 600+ stores (over 30% of the national total) 48.Starbucks Korea’s portfolio is mainly company-operated (Shinsegae joint venture), with only a few licensed concept stores.Unique formats (Reserve, premium café lounges) have.been introduced.The market has high per-capita coffee consumption, which fueled robust traffic growth (Starbucks Korea’s daily customers often exceeded 1 million pre-pandemic).Growth Outlook (2025–2027): - Base case: Starbucks Korea may sustain ~5–8% annual revenue growth.Store count could approach 2,400– 2,500 by 2027 (adding ~100 per year, though growth will slow as urban saturation nears).Comparable sales growth might be mid-single digits if the economy remains stable, possibly aided by ongoing urbanization (new stores in secondary cities).- Upside: Continued GDP growth and cultural affinity for coffee could keep traffic rising.Starbucks might exploit location density (e.g.partnerships for in-store kiosks, beyond cafés).If wage inflation can be better managed (leveraging the recent closure of the largely unionized joint venture), margins could improve.- Downside: The Korean coffee market is fiercely competitive with 100,000+ cafés including local chains (Café Bene, Ediya, etc.).Slower economy or a strong won raising import costs could curb growth.A scenario with <3% comp growth and only minimal store expansion might see revenue grow only 2–4%.- Risks: Shrinking margins are a risk – Starbucks Korea’s operating margin was under 5% in 2023 47 , partly due to high partner wages.Further wage increases (Korean labor laws) could burden profitability.Market cannibalization is also an issue as new stores often open near existing ones.Moreover, South Korea’s economic linkages to global trade cycles could introduce volatility.Strategic Initiatives: Starbucks Korea continues to innovate locally.Drive-thru growth is significant: 145+ drive-thrus in the region (many in Seoul area) were operating by 2023 49.Starbucks Korea also invests in digital: e.g.mobile ordering via its app, integration with local payment (Naver Pay, Kakao Pay), and introducing a corporate card for companies.Product-wise, Starbucks Korea offers unique items (sweet potato lattes, Han-mi-cha tea) catering to local tastes.Starbucks Reserve experiences (e.g.Reserve Store in Garosu-gil, premium Omakase coffee events) are aimed at high-end consumers.The joint venture is also piloting store formats with private meeting rooms and advanced barista equipment, reflecting the country’s focus on café culture.Lastly, Starbucks Korea funds social initiatives (e.g.coffee recycling) to strengthen its brand image.Mexico (Latin America) Historic Performance: Starbucks has a moderate presence in Mexico under an exclusive franchise operated by Alsea SAB.As of 2023, Mexico had on the order of 700–750 Starbucks stores.Alsea reported that over half its sales come from Mexico, suggesting Starbucks Mexico annual revenues near $2.9–3.0 billion (given Alsea’s 2023 revenue of ~MXN 77 billion, mostly from Starbucks 50 ).In Q 1 2023 Alsea’s Starbucks revenue was MXN 17.67 billion ($980 million) 50 , implying ~MXN 70–75 billion annual.Same- store sales at Alsea (mostly Starbucks) grew strongly in early 2023 (+23.5% in Q 1) 51 as the economy rebounded from COVID.Store Network: Starbucks Mexico is nearly all licensed/franchised (no company-operated stores).The first Mexican store opened in 2002; by 2024 there are ~750 outlets, primarily in Mexico City and other urban centers.Recent years saw slower store growth (~20–30 openings per year), as the market matures.Growth Outlook (2025–2027): - Base case: Mexican sales are tied to Alsea’s execution and the broader economy.We expect mid-single-digit revenue growth (4–6% per year) driven by moderate store expansion and pricing.Mexico’s coffee market is growing steadily, and Starbucks benefits as a premium brand.

Store Network: Starbucks Mexico is nearly all licensed/franchised (no company-operated stores).The first Mexican store opened in 2002; by 2024 there are ~750 outlets, primarily in Mexico City and other urban centers.Recent years saw slower store growth (~20–30 openings per year), as the market matures.Growth Outlook (2025–2027): - Base case: Mexican sales are tied to Alsea’s execution and the broader economy.We expect mid-single-digit revenue growth (4–6% per year) driven by moderate store expansion and pricing.Mexico’s coffee market is growing steadily, and Starbucks benefits as a premium brand.- Upside: If Alsea aggressively expands (driven by strong tourism post-pandemic) and currency effects are favorable, growth could reach 8–10% annually.A vibrant Mexican consumer market (rising incomes) could boost comps.- Downside: As Starbucks Mexico is a franchised business, it is more exposed to partners’ costs.If Peso weakens or inflation outpaces pricing, real sales (in USD terms) could stagnate or decline.A downturn in Mexican consumer spending would cap growth near 1–2%.- Risks: Competitive pressure from local chains (Italica, Cafe Punta del Cielo) and international fast-food coffee (Mc Café, Dunkin’) is rising.Regulatory changes (sugar taxes, labor laws) could impact costs.Strategic Initiatives: Alsea (Starbucks licensee) focuses on store network expansion in underpenetrated cities and highway rest-stops, and on localized menu items (e.g.regional coffee beans).Digital integration (Starbucks app, loyalty points, delivery via Rappi) is ramping up.Alsea also aims to convert more Mini-Mex stores to Starbucks-branded or develop Starbucks Reserve in major cities.Partnerships with local suppliers (e.g.Mexican pastries) help localize the experience.The franchising model means strategic changes require Alsea’s execution; Starbucks corporation provides global branding and digital platform support.Taiwan Historic Performance: Starbucks Taiwan, operated under a licensing agreement with Uni-President, is a well-established market.By 2024 Taiwan had approximately 450–500 Starbucks stores.Pre-COVID growth was robust (double-digit store growth), and consumption remained relatively strong through the pandemic.While no public financials are released separately, industry estimates suggest Taiwan contributed on the order of $200–250 million in annual revenue.The market is mature, with high mobile-order penetration (similar to Japan/Korea levels).Growth Outlook (2025–2027): - Base case: We expect modest growth (3–5% annually).Comps should be stable to slightly up (+1–3%) as Taiwan’s economy slowly recovers and digital orders remain popular.Additional store openings will be limited to high-traffic urban spots; store count may reach ~550 by 2027.- Upside: If cross-strait tourism returns or Starbucks Taiwan introduces premium Reserve stores (e.g.expanding the one in Taipei), growth could reach +6–8%.- Downside: Downturn in Taiwan’s economy or new COVID outbreaks could stall traffic.Given Taiwan’s wealth, consumer coffee demand might soften gradually (aging population).In a pessimistic case, growth could be ~1–2% per year.- Risks: High density of competitors (local specialty cafes) and a relatively plateaued market.Exchange rate swings (NT$ vs.US$) affect reported currency conversions (if any).Strategic Initiatives: Starbucks Taiwan leverages Uni-President’s retail expertise.New store formats (e.g.smaller outlets in transit hubs, experiment kiosks in corporate campuses) are being tested.The chain has rolled out more digital promotions (stars loyalty linked with drink/reward campaigns) and integrated mobile payment systems popular in Taiwan.Seasonal offerings draw on local tastes (e.g.taro or black sugar flavors).Taiwan also serves as a hub for experimenting with cutting-edge technology (like AI-powered inventory management) before wider rollouts.

Assumptions include moderate GDP growth (2%), mild inflation, and ongoing digital adoption.Risks include wage/labor unrest and competitor discounting.• China: Base: ~15%–18% CAGR (10% store growth + 5% comp); Upside: ~20%–25% (faster store roll- out, stronger comps); Downside: ~5%–10% (slower economy, higher competition).Assumes moderate Chinese GDP growth (~4–6%), easing of COVID restrictions, and execution of 9,000-store plan.Key risk is market share loss to Luckin/Cotti.• Japan: Base: ~3%–4% CAGR (low comps, modest store growth); Upside: ~5% (tourism rebound, Reserve expansion); Downside: ~0%–1% (economic stagnation, demography).Assumes weak domestic growth (0–2%), yen stability.Risk: saturated market and limited domestic consumption growth.• Canada: Base: ~4% (steady comps, slight store growth); Upside: ~6% (higher traffic, digital gains); Downside: ~1–2% (economic drag).Assumes similar macro trends to U.S.Risks: high wages, possibly union movement (though not yet significant).• South Korea: Base: ~7% (slowing comp, steady store growth); Upside: ~10% (continued urban expansion); Downside: ~3% (margin pressure, saturation).Assumes healthy GDP (2–3%) and resilient domestic demand.Risks include margin squeeze and market cannibalization.• Mexico: Base: ~5% (moderate GDP growth); Upside: ~8% (expansion beyond metro centers, tourism); Downside: ~1–2% (peso weakness, inflation).Assumes Mexico’s economy and peso remain stable.Risk from Alsea’s ability and currency fluctuations.• UK: Base: ~5% (moderate sales growth); Upside: ~8% (tourism, market recovery); Downside: ~0–2% (prolonged austerity).Assumes slow UK GDP growth (~1%).Risks: high inflation cost-of-living pressures, regulatory costs (UK national living wage).• Taiwan: Base: ~4%; Upside: ~6%; Downside: ~1–2%.Assumes stable economy.Risks: competition with local tea/dessert shops.• Philippines: Base: ~10%; Upside: ~15%; Downside: ~5%.Assumes continued robust GDP (6–7%).Risks: currency (peso) swings, political shifts.• Indonesia: Base: ~9%; Upside: ~12%; Downside: ~4%.Assumes GDP ~5%.Risks: strong local competitors, commodity price swings.Each forecast hinges on global and local economic conditions, competitive dynamics, and Starbucks’ strategic execution.For example, a global recession would shift most markets toward the downside, whereas efficient cost management and innovation could enhance results.Global Strategic and Operational Initiatives Across markets, Starbucks has rolled out consistent strategic initiatives: • Store Portfolio Expansion: The company continues to grow its global footprint, targeting underserved cities and formats.Notable is the proliferation of drive-thru stores (e.g.over 600 drive- thrus in Asia Pacific 49 , hundreds more in the U.S.), as well as pickup-only “Starbucks Now” micro- stores in the U.S.and hybrid formats in urban cores.Roughly 50% of Starbucks stores are now licensed; many growth opportunities lie in converting licenses to company operation or adding licensed partners.

g.sustainable cup discount expanded to Canada in 2024).Conclusion From 2018 through 2024, Starbucks delivered robust top-line growth globally (doubling revenues from ~$19 B in FY 2019 to ~$36 B by FY 2023) 1 , driven by store expansion and recovering same-store sales.Net income and margins recovered post-COVID but were dented in 2022–24 by high labor costs and inflation.The company’s key markets (U.S.and China) remain growth engines: U.S.sales have stayed strong, while China’s 10% annual store growth fuels double-digit revenue gains.Other markets like South Korea, UK,.Japan, and Canada are important pillars with tailored strategies.Across all regions, Starbucks is navigating shifting consumer habits by investing in digital and loyalty programs, refining store formats, and balancing price with value.Looking ahead to 2025–2027, we project continued albeit variable growth across markets.The base case envisions global comparable sales rising in the mid-single digits annually and store count increasing ~5% per year, lifting revenues to roughly $45–50 billion by FY 2027.Upside scenarios assume faster market recoveries (especially in China and Asia) and higher traffic, pushing revenues north of $55 B with stronger margins.Downside risks include economic slowdowns or fierce local competition that could flatten or contract same-store sales, resulting in single-digit revenue growth.The company’s success will hinge on executing its reinvention strategy—improving the in-store experience, leveraging technology, and staying flexible to local tastes—while managing costs.Starbucks’ global footprint, strong brand, and financial strength position it well to navigate these challenges and pursue growth in each key market.Sources: Starbucks public financial releases and filings 12 4 25 3 , Starbucks regional annual reports 39 42 , and business news coverage 14 10 provide the data and analysis above.These include official Starbucks 10-Ks, earnings releases, and verified news articles.
